# Year in Pixels

First of all thank you for your interest on this little tool.

This tool was made to keep track of your mood during all year using pixels. You can load this page every day and select how you're feeling. The tool will keep track of your mood and give you some visualization about how you've felt during the year.

The idea for this tool is not new at all, but I've never seen this format online before. I hope you enjoy it.

You can import/export your calendar too, in case you're using different browsers or computers.

## Tecnology

- Node.js
- jQuery
- Chartist.js
